### Notes
This app was really fun to make and I learned a lot about the basics of app creation, including formatting tables and receiving information from APIs to use in my apps. Using a podfile was something very new to me and I enjoyed seeing how it transformed my app from plain ol' cells with writing into actual movie posters!
